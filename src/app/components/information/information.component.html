        <p class="card-text">
          Once a user successfully authenticates with the <strong>RealWorld API</strong>, the server generates a 
          <strong>JWT (JSON Web Token)</strong> and sends it back to the client. This token is essential for maintaining 
          secure communication between the client and the server during the user's session.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h5 mt-3">Key Processes After Authentication:</h2>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Token Storage:</strong> The JWT is stored securely on the client side, typically in local storage or session storage.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Authorization Headers:</strong> For subsequent API requests, the client includes the JWT in the Authorization header using the format: <code>Bearer &lt;token&gt;</code>.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Access Control:</strong> The server validates the JWT to ensure the user is authenticated before granting access to protected resources.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Session Validity:</strong> JWTs have an expiration time. When expired, the user is logged out or prompted to re-authenticate.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="card-text mt-4">
          This process ensures that users can access the application's features securely and that unauthorized access is effectively prevented. 
          By leveraging the RealWorld API and JWT, developers can create modern and secure web applications with ease.
